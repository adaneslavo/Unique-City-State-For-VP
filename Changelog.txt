This is the update probably all of you awaited for a very long time. After important v12 fixing few crucial bugs, I decided (after the small talk with @Jarcast) to expand the mod a bit after months of neglecting.

The core of the v13 update are of course new City-States you can integrate with. There are 8 new Religious City-States, all with new abilities. Everything is comptible with CSL, PO and MC mods (all these modmods are updated and linked in my signature).

Of course, new City-States are not everything. Because many people complained about how plain and useless are the CSs abilities, I decided  (with help of @Flamingcheesepie) to spend almost 70% of time on reworking all so far coded (partially by @enginseer, partially by me) abilities. There were few goals I had in mind doing this rework:
a) make the abilities stronger and with more impact on gameplay (no more abilities adding only +x yields on certain buildings, improvements or resources);
b) add some abilities introcuving new improvemnts, buildings, units or resources;
c) "spread" the abilities to allow the player use them in different situations and gameplay styles (each ability with few exceptions consists of at least 2 smaller parts focusing on different things, together creating the complete thematic flavour);
d) change some abilities to fit more the historical accuracy of the nation or leader of particular City-State;

With this in mind, almost 90% of the abilities were reworked and in rest there could be small value tweaks or other minor changes. Have that in mind when playing the v13 for the first time, and report any crucial bugs you notice or some feedback info about how weak or how strong certain abilities are.

Beside that I expanded lua abilities with very rich notifications explaining the most important events that can happen and did hundreds of small tweaks and fixes of bugs I found during long hours of my work.

Last thing worth mentioning is a total rework of current texts of the CSs abilities. There are now filled with new icons, including those added in latest VP versions. Text are enriched with colours (colour code copied from MW mod) informing about what is the topic of the buff (f.e. brown=improvement, dark blue=terrain, etc.). Of course there were also multiple minor fixes, adding more details, improving readability, and dozens of text fixes.

I hope you'll enjoy the mod, as I enjoyed the work on that version. OF course it's not the end, but an important stage was ended. Now I can start working on new CSs and when I get some feedback from you, I will surely try to balance the stuff from this update.

I hope also more people will try this mod, as it is now much more similar to Civ6's Suzerain mod in terms of ability power and their diversity.

Below I share with the link where we did deep planning phase for ability ideas and new City-States. Here you can look at them in a pleasant way without running the game:
