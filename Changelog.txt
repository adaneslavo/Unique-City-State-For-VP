- fixes:	
	- CS now give Missionaries as follows:
		- if player has found no Religion and has no Majority Religion in capital, then a Missionary is not spawned;
		- if player has found no Religion and has a Majority Religion of other player in its capital, then a Missionary will spawn with that Majority Religion;
		- if player has found a Religion then a Missionary is spawned with his Religion regardless of the Majority Religion in the capital;
		- if player has found a Religion and lost his Holy City, a Missionary is spawned still with his Religion;
