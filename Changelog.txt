Changelog:

	- added few missing civilopedia texts;
	- finally used a promotion icon made by @gwennog years ago (Iskanwaya);

		- Maritime:
			- Byblos: now gives +5% Production towards all Naval Units and World Wonders;
		- Mercantile:
			- Antwerp: lesser bonus to Merchants, but instead you get -10% Gold Purchase bonus;
			- Colombo: now heals all units on a finished international trade route;
			- Hong Kong: increases growth and gold per citizen, but at a risk of people migration to Hong Kong; when they do so, you get some reward in Gold and Influence;
