This update contains also total rework of city-state's passives mechanic and also introduces new active-passive mechanic ability, which sound bad, but is really simple. First, I didn't like the currnt state of pssives and how they evolved. It was a nice concept, but turn out to be really complicated and difficult to understand, epecially when player had no imapct on it at all. In its place I introduced new active-passive mechanic. It means that some Major player actions on city-states, apart from gaining some stuff for themselves like gaining additional yields or gaining access to unique abilities I hope you like very much after rework, may change the city-state behaviour somehow. Seems complicated? So few examples:
1. Each diplomatic mission performed in a City-State increase contribute to their border growth, incresing their territory.
2. Each diplomatic mission performed in a City-State increase their defensive capabilities (CS), and the value of change depends on City-State Personality (less in Friendly, more in Hostile).
3. Completing a quest gives you 1 Suzerain point with that City-State. These Suzerain points...
