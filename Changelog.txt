[FUTURE]
This update contains also total rework of City-State's passives mechanic and also introduces new active-passive mechanic, which sounds bad, but is really simple.
First, I didn't like the current state of passives and how they evolved. It was a nice concept, but turn out to be really complicated and difficult to understand, epecially when player had no impact on it at all. In its place I introduced new active-passive mechanic. It means that some Major player's actions on City-States, apart from gaining some stuff for themselves like gaining additional yields or gaining access to unique abilities I hope you like very much after rework) may change the City-State's behaviour somehow. Seems complicated? So few examples:
	1. Each diplomatic mission performed in a City-State contributes to their border growth, incresing their territory a bit, so the more such actions, the stronger CS becomes;
	2. Each diplomatic mission performed in a City-State increases their defensive capabilities (HP), and the value of change depends on City-State's Personality (less in Friendly, more in Hostile);
	3. Performing some actions grants the player new Suzerain Points or takes them; Suzerain Points open up new possible outcomes when gathered in bigger quantities.
		a) performing a diplomatic mission grants you 1 Suzerain Point with that City-State;
		b) completing a quest grants you 1 Suzerain Point with that City-State;
		c) pledging a protection grants you 1 Suzerain Point with that City-State (one-time boost);
		d) liberation of a City-State grants 5 Suzerain Points with it;
		e) taking a Tribute takes 1/3 of accumulated Suzerain Points with that City-State and Heavy Tribute takes 1/2 of them;
		f) if player Pledges Protection, but let another civ to take the Tribute over the City-State, this player loses 1/4 of his Suzerain Points;
		g) declaring a war to a City-State takes all accumulated Suzerain Points with that City-State;
Suzerain Points accumulate during the game and are tied to both Major and Minor players. If player passes certain threshold of Suzerain Points then:
	a) above 3: player gains small Production bonus in his Capital; City-State gains small Growth boost;
	b) above 7: player gains small Science bonus; City-State gains small City HP boost;
	c) above 12: player gains bigger Production bonus in all Cities and bigger Science bonus; City-State gains increased production of its units;
	d) above 18: City-State gains small City Defense boost;
	e) above 25: player gains access to City-State's ability (4th possible way of gaining the access after being an Ally, having an Embassy or achieving high Influence level);
	f) above 30: City-State gains increased production of anything and player cannot declare war to that City-State;
If City-State is conquered, all Suzerain Points with it are zeroed, even after liberation.
This way player can contribute to City-States' power and increase their value. If there are multiple players taking care about the City-State, then it can become well shaped and strong ally.
Gaining Suzerain Points is sort of automatic feature and should be AI friendly, as it requires performing regular actions AI also does during its games. Passives are granted automatically.
